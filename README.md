This is a repo for the Data Science Club website for upcoming events that the Data Science Club might be organizing.

I have used HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework to develop this website.
This is highly responsive website with all necessary details I could have added in the given limited time.

If I would have given more time I would have added animations and an full Event Section to make this website more attractive and effective.
Moreover, I would have fixed some responsiveness issue if I would have got more time.

## To run website
1. Clone or download this repo in any of your folder
2. Open index.html inside the folder and its Done
